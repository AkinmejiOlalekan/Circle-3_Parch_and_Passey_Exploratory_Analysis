# Parch and Posey Sales & Performance Analysis

## Project Overview
This project explores a structured dataset containing **accounts, sales representatives, regions, orders, and web events**. The goal is to derive meaningful business insights that guide Posey's **management decisions**, identify their **top-performing customers and sales reps**, track **regional performance**, and evaluate **seasonal sales trends**.
